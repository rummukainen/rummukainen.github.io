I am a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/" target="_blank">International Audio Laboratories</a> of the <a href="https://www.iis.fraunhofer.de/en.html" target="_blank">Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits (IIS)</a>. I specialize in spatial audio, multi-modal psychophysics, and data analysis. I like to work with virtual reality to sample and transform multi-modal sensory experiences to cognitive performance measures and quality judgments.
