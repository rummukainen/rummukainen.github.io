abstract = "The effects of using two-dimensional video projection together with parametric three-dimensional spatial audio reproduction system are examined in this study. The discrepancy between the auditory and visual events, and differing depth cues, are evaluated by means of subjective evaluations using the method of adjustment. The results show the Directional Audio Coding to be well suited for immersive audiovisual setups allowing a large area of viewing positions."
