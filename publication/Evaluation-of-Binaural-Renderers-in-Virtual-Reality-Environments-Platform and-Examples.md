abstract = "One of the challenges of virtual reality technology is to provide convincing sensory information to users, to give the illusion of presence within the virtual environment. Audio-visual input combined with self-motion is a step beyond traditional cinematic content, whereby the audio renderer must accommodate a limitless number of potential user interactions and movements within an acoustic field. In this e-Brief, a framework for an online (real-time) 6 degrees-of-freedom evaluation platform is detailed. The platform allows psychoacoustic research and subjective testing of binaural audio renderers for virtual reality applications and finds application in the development of the MPEG-I Audio Standard."
