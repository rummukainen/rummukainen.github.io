abstract = "In this work the effect of reproduction setup on the perception of natural scene attributes was studied. Discrimination of reproduced real-world scenes in movement, openness and noisiness was inspected between an immersive large reproduction setup and a non-immersive small reproduction setup. The results show decreased sensitivity for movement discrimination and increased sensitivity for noisiness discrimination when using the large setup, and content dependent effects for openness discrimination. The results have implications on future content descriptors and quality evaluation in large-screen systems and spatial audio setups."
