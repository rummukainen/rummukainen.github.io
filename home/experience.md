  description = """ The research in my dissertation may be classified in two categories: understanding human perceptual information processing under natural audio-visual conditions and, based on this knowledge, evaluating the quality of experience and content perception in immersive audiovisual reproductions. The main concept guiding this work is the observation that there is no need to simulate the whole world if every aspect of it cannot be perceived.
